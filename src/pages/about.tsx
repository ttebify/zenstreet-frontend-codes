          <h2>Here's Why We Started This</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional investment vehicles and opportunities are generally very
            expensive and require huge capital investments. ZenStreet was
            created with the low income earner in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer smart, simple, and affordable investment solutions by
            providing you with highly affordable financial opportunities and a
            chance to pool resources with others, collectively provide liquid to
            capital intensive projects, make and split the profit.
